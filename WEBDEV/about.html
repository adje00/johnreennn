              <br>I'm John Ren Legaspi and I was born on the 20th of march, 2002 in Cauayan City, Isabela. I live in Cauayan City, Isabela
              <br> and studying at University of Perpetual Help Laguna Isabela - Campus 3rd year college with the course ofBachelor Science
              <br> In Informaton Technology and  I like to play basketball, see the sunset, play online games and ride a bike to see the 
              <br> of nature and enjoy every moment in life.  
              <br>
              <br> I am a person who is posistive about every aspect of life there are many things i like to do,
              <br>to see, and to experience because trying new things is not only helping us to vanquish those fears,
              <br>but it also allows us to expand our minds and learn both about said new thing and abouts ourselves.
              <br>There's nothing quite like or as memorable as  the thrill of a new experience.
